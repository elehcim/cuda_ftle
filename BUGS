Notes about things that are broken/quirks:

This -is- the 0.1 revision of the software, so
all things should be taken with a grain of salt:
computational accuracy, speed claims, etc.

However, the following are known to be bad:

2009/08/10: The batch mode appears to lock up after
a random number of frames in the CUDA tracer code.
A tested workaround is to add the -v (--verbose)
flag; yes, this does work inexplicably! --RCJ
